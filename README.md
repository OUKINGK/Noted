In June 2024, I became a certified Professional Scrum Master, and since then, I’ve been consistently working to improve my skillset by pursuing additional certifications. However, one of the biggest challenges for new PSMs is finding work without prior experience.

Many companies are transitioning from traditional Project Management systems to the Scrum framework. This shift requires substantial effort and someone with experience to implement it successfully, making it difficult for newly certified Scrum Masters to break into the industry.

With this in mind, I came up with an idea: why not "create" my own team and develop my own software, gaining hands-on experience and deepening my knowledge of various related fields such as development, design, and testing?

By collaborating with AI models like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, MS Copilot, and others, I’ll be applying the Scrum framework to create my own software. Who knows, I might even release it to the public someday!

Development of my first piece of software, a notepad called "Noted" has officially begun on 21/10/2024! This initial project will be the foundation of my goal. Feel free to test it out and let me know what you think!
